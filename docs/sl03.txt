Let's kick off our project. We'll name it "rebel" and use the repository domain
"github.com/preferit/rebel".

We choose to create a command, ie. package main. The implications for
our ability to evolve

<ol>
<li>You Cannot share any logic within it with others (including
yourself), Go disallows the import of main packages</li>
<li>API documentation is hidden when using e.g. go doc, as a result of
(1)</li>
</ol>
